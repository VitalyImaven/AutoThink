Started my career as a junior developer at Microsoft in Seattle, then moved to a senior role at Google where I led the infrastructure team for 5 years. Currently serving as Principal Engineer at a Series B fintech startup.

My technical strengths include distributed systems architecture, cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Azure), microservices design, Kubernetes orchestration, Python, Go, Java, and database optimization. I'm particularly passionate about system reliability and performance optimization.

ACADEMIC CREDENTIALS

Graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from MIT in 2012. Completed my Master's degree in Distributed Systems from Stanford University in 2015. Also hold AWS Solutions Architect Professional certification and Kubernetes CKA certification.

CAREER HISTORY

2012-2015: Software Development Engineer at Microsoft Azure team
2015-2020: Senior Software Engineer at Google Cloud Platform
2020-Present: Principal Engineer at FinTech Innovations Inc.

Throughout my career, I've built systems serving millions of users, reduced infrastructure costs by 40% through optimization, and mentored over 20 junior engineers.

AREAS OF FOCUS

I'm deeply interested in cloud-native architectures, serverless computing, observability systems, and developer experience tools. Always exploring new ways to improve system performance and developer productivity.

NOTABLE ACCOMPLISHMENTS

- Architected a payment processing system handling $2B annually
- Reduced API latency by 70% through caching optimization
- Led migration of monolithic system to microservices (300+ services)
- Published 5 technical papers on distributed consensus algorithms

CURRENT VENTURE

I'm building StreamlineAI - an intelligent automation platform for enterprise workflows.

ABOUT STREAMLINEAI

We're creating an AI-powered platform that automates repetitive business processes. Companies waste 30% of their time on manual data entry, report generation, and workflow coordination. Our intelligent system learns from your existing processes and automates them end-to-end.

THE CHALLENGE WE'RE ADDRESSING

Enterprise teams spend countless hours on mundane tasks - copying data between systems, generating weekly reports, routing approvals, and coordinating across departments. This manual work costs companies millions and prevents employees from focusing on strategic initiatives.

OUR APPROACH

StreamlineAI uses machine learning to observe how teams work, identify patterns, and create automated workflows. Unlike traditional RPA tools that require extensive programming, our system learns naturally from user behavior. It integrates with existing tools (Salesforce, Slack, email, databases) and creates intelligent automation that adapts to changes.

BUSINESS MOMENTUM

We launched our beta 8 months ago and now have 25 enterprise customers including Fortune 500 companies. Monthly recurring revenue hit $180K last month with 40% month-over-month growth. Our average customer saves 200 hours per month, generating an ROI of 300% within 3 months. Customer retention is 98% and we have a Net Promoter Score of 72.

THE TEAM BEHIND IT

Our founding team includes myself as CTO, bringing 12 years of infrastructure experience from Microsoft and Google. Our CEO, James Park, previously led product at Asana and brings 8 years of workflow automation expertise. Our Head of ML, Dr. Elena Rodriguez, has a PhD in Machine Learning from Berkeley and spent 5 years at DeepMind working on reinforcement learning systems.

We've assembled a team of 15 engineers, all from top tech companies, with deep expertise in ML, enterprise software, and distributed systems.

FINANCIAL PLANS

We're raising a $5M Series A to accelerate growth. The funds will be allocated as follows:
- $2M for engineering team expansion (hire 10 more engineers)
- $1.5M for sales and marketing (expand to mid-market segment)
- $1M for infrastructure and AI training costs
- $500K for customer success and support team

Our goal is to reach $3M ARR by end of next year and expand to European markets.

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT

We're backed by Y Combinator (W2024 batch) and several prominent angel investors including the founders of Zapier and Notion. We've been featured in TechCrunch, Forbes, and VentureBeat. Our vision is to make every enterprise team 10x more productive through intelligent automation.
